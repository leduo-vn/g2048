# Game 2048 

The program is a spin-off of the official version of 2048 created by **Gabriele Cirulli**.

The game is created for the purpose of up-skilling for the SIT378.

The knowledge has applied for the program included:
-   Room Database: Set up, configuration, Add, Update, Read from database

- Java Practice: For the function of the game

- Android Development: Create Activities and device 's interaction


## Include
* Full Source Code of the game
* The video running the game (g2048)

## Current Functionalities
* Need to fill the name before playing
* If user is existed, the high score would update based on the latest achivement
* If user is not existed, start the whole new game
* All the move (Up, Down,Left, Right) is working properly
* Game End when there are no further move or space left
* User could choose to restart game

## Further work

The app  is not perfectly yet due to the time limit. Some further work (for practice) is:
* Add the Score Board to show top 10 Users with High Scores
* Create user's passwork with script for security purpose
* Use GestureListener to get risk of the keyboard buttons

## Built With

* Android Studio 3.6.1
* Room Database ver 2.2.5

## Testing
* SAMSUNG_E5 : physical device (my phone specifically!! XD)
* Pixel XL: virtual device
